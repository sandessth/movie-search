**Introduction:**

> Welcome to the documentation for the Movie Search Application built using React, Vite, and state management with Context API. This documentation is designed to help developers understand and utilize the Movie Search Application effectively. 

>The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to set up, design, and implement the Movie Search Application. It covers the necessary steps to create a fully functional movie search feature, including integrating with the Movies and TV Shows Database API and managing state using the Context API or Redux.

>This documentation is intended for developers who have a basic understanding of React and want to build a movie search application using modern tools and state management techniques. It assumes familiarity with JavaScript, React concepts, and API integration.

**Getting Started:** 

>Before proceeding with building the Movie Search Application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites and development environment set up:

>**Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

>**Code Editor:** Choose a code editor of your choice for writing and editing the project code. Popular options include **Visual Studio Code**, Atom, or Sublime Text. Ensure that your code editor is installed and properly configured.

>**Terminal or Command Prompt:** You will need a terminal or command prompt to execute commands and run scripts. Most operating systems come with a default terminal, such as Terminal (macOS), Command Prompt (Windows), or Terminal (Linux). Make sure you can access the terminal or command prompt from your development environment.

Once you have the prerequisites in place, you can proceed to the next sections of the documentation, which will guide you through the process of setting up the React project, designing the components, managing state, connecting to the Movies and TV Shows Database API, and testing the Movie Search Application.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues during the setup or while following the instructions, refer to the troubleshooting section of this documentation or consult the official documentation for the respective tools or libraries used in this project.

Now that you are familiar with accessing and navigating the documentation and have set up the necessary development environment, let's move on to the next steps and start building the Movie Search Application.
